    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Ally - a web designer and developer born and raised in London, currently based in Osaka, Japan. I love all things web and love to keep up to date with design and development trends.</p>
    <p>I have a Master's degree in Web Design and always aim to adhere to best practices, such as semantic markup, accessibility, and creating great content. Whilst I'm still relatively new into my web journey, I'm loving the constant learning involved!</p>
    <p>My background is in languages and I have a First-Class degree in Linguistics and Japanese. My Japanese language ability is upper intermediate / lower advanced, around JLPT N3 - N2.</p>
